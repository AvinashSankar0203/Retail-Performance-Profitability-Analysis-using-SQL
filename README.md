# 🧠 Retail Profitability & KPI Intelligence System  
### SQL → Metrics Layer → Power BI Decision Dashboard

A decision-intelligence analytics system that transforms raw retail transactions into profit drivers, customer value signals, and pricing optimization insights.

This project focuses on designing a production-style **business metrics layer** using advanced SQL and exposing it through an interactive Power BI dashboard to support real strategic decision-making.

---

## 🚀 Why This Project Matters

Retail organizations often track revenue but lack visibility into:

- True profit drivers  
- High-value customers  
- Loss-making products  
- Discount strategies that destroy margins  

This system converts transactional data into **actionable business intelligence** that enables:

- Pricing optimization  
- Customer prioritization  
- Profitability improvement  
- Operational performance monitoring

## 📊 Dataset

**Superstore Retail Dataset (Kaggle)**

- ~9,994 transactions  
- Multi-dimensional business data including:

  - Orders  
  - Customers  
  - Products  
  - Sales  
  - Profit  
  - Discount  
  - Shipping mode  
  - Region & category  

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

**Data Layer:** MySQL 8+  
**Language:** SQL  
**Decision Layer:** Power BI  

### SQL Concepts Demonstrated

- Time-series analysis  
- Profit margin & KPI calculations  
- Advanced aggregations  
- Date parsing & transformation  

---

## 📈 Core Capabilities

### Time-Series Performance Engine

- Monthly sales and profit tracking  
- Month-over-month growth calculation  
- Trend acceleration & decline detection  

### Profitability Intelligence

- Profit margin by category and region  
- Identification of high-revenue but loss-making products  
- Category-level performance comparison  

### Customer Value Modeling

- Customer ranking by total profit  
- Identification of high-value customer segments  

### Discount Strategy Analysis

- Profitability by discount band  
- Margin compression detection  
- Diminishing returns at higher discount levels  

### Operational Performance Signals

- Shipping mode efficiency comparison  
- Regional performance evaluation  

---

## 📊 KPI Framework Implemented

The dashboard enables real-time monitoring of:

- **Total Sales**
- **Total Profit**
- **Profit Margin %**
- **Total Orders**
- **Average Order Value**
- **Total Customers**

---

## 🔍 Key Business Insights

- Revenue ≠ Profit — margin visibility is critical  
- A small percentage of customers generates the majority of profit  
- Higher discount bands consistently reduce profitability  
- Some high-volume products should be repriced or removed  
- Shipping mode impacts operational efficiency  

---

## 🧭 Business Decisions Enabled

This system allows stakeholders to:

- Optimize discount strategies  
- Prioritize high-value customers  
- Reprice or eliminate loss-making SKUs  
- Improve regional inventory and category focus  
- Monitor overall business health through KPIs
